Installation & Setup
Backend Setup
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/additimehta-genai-genesis.git
cd additimehta-genai-genesis
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Python Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys (e.g., COHERE_API_KEY, GENAI credentials).

# Frontend Setup
Navigate to the Frontend Directory:
cd frontend
Install Node Dependencies:
npm install
Start the Frontend Development Server:
npm run dev
Running the Application
Backend (API):
Launch the Flask application:
ppython segment_flask.py
python gemini_and_cohere_flask.py
python deep_research_flask.py
python final_generation_flask.py

The API will start and listen on the configured port (default is 5003).

Frontend (Web Interface):
With the development server running, access the application at http://localhost:3000 or the port specified in your configuration.
